# NicsTestDataGenerator
A small application to help generate data for manual or automated testing.

First attempt will be to create this application using Lazarus IDE (Free Pascal) so that the application can be used on multiple platforms.

Goals:
1. A small project to apply fundation studies such as IREB and ISTQB.
2. A small project that is used to learn multiple languages by rewriting the same requirements in different languages.
3. A small project to familiarise with Agile challenges using Extreme Programming and Test Driven Development (TDD).
